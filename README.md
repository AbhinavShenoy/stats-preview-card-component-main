## Overview

It took a little over 2 hours to make the first version of the website. The refactored version took 1.5 hours.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://stats-preview-card-component-main-abhinavshenoy.vercel.app/]

## My process

The idea was to write HTML markup and style it using flexbox.

On first attempt, I designed the site using fixed widths and heights. This led to a lot media queries being needed to 
ensure responsiveness.

So I refactored the CSS code to use relative units, mainly % , to make the site more responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- Relative lengths are very important to ensure responsiveness.
- The decision of how the HTML is ordered plays a significant role in the styling.
